# The Block and The Ball

A simple game where the player controls the blue block and tries to prevent the red ball from falling out of the screen. 
The player controls the block with the left and right arrow keys.
The player gets a point from every successful hit against the ball but at the time the ball's speed will increase.
The ball will bounce in a different direction when it hits either a wall or the block.
When a player loses, their points are saved into a "highscores.txt" file and the game will restart.
The "highscores.txt" file is saved in the same folder as the game's Python file.

## Important!

The game was made using Python's Pygame module.
The module must be installed before starting the game to ensure that the game works as intended.
